ECDAR is a TIOA modeler based on UPPAAL. A similar tool based on UPPAAL already
exists.

\paragraph{Times}
Times\footnote{\url{http://www.timestool.com}} is a tool for modeling and
implementation of embedded systems. Times is a graphical simulator, in which a
user can validate dynamic behavior of a system and see how tasks execute - much
like Ecdar, but it can also do code-generation. However there is a difference
between Ecdar and Times.

Looking at what are taking as input by the controller - Times simple takes a
model and generates code. ECDAR: Synthesize models for you so to avoid “that”
stage. In ECDAR you have the possibility to you use composition.

\paragraph{Composable Code Generation for Model-Based Development}
by Kirk Schloegel et al. present a framework for generating
code\cite{composable-code-generation}. They emphasize how utilizing their
framework, code generators aren't programs separated from a corresponding
graphical model as it often have been in the past. Our code generator isn't
based on this framework, however their approach on developing code generators
with focus on graphical models is related to our approach with ECDAR.

\paragraph{Code Synthesis for Timed Automata}
by Tobias Amnell et al. present a framework for the development of real-time
embedded systems\cite{Amnell:2002:CST:779110.779112}. Their work is similar to
our project. In the article the illustrate how their framework is based on timed
automata and real-time tasks - relative to our concept with ECDAR.
