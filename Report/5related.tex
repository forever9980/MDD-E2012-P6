The aim of this project is to develop a tool for automatic synthesis of
Java-code, from the modeling tool: ECDAR. However there already exist tools
similar too ECDAR.

\paragraph{TIMES} is a graphical tool set for modeling, schedulability analysis
for implementation of embedded
systems\footnote{\url{http://www.timestool.com}}. It allows users to model a
system and the abstract behavior of its environment. Like ECDAR, TIMES is based
on timed automata (see Sec. \ref{introduction-ecdar}). Similarly TIMES derive
from UPPAAL and is based on the standard for modeling real-time
systems \cite{Alur1994:183}.  Times is extended by real-time tasks, checking the
reachability and schedulability of a modeled automata. It too can simulate
models and validate dynamic behavior of a system: Users can see how tasks
executes according to time. The simulator shows a graphical representation of
the generated trace, showing the time points when the tasks are released,
invoked, suspended, resumed, and completed.

TIMES can be used for code-generation, as illustrated Tobias Amnell et
al. \cite{Amnell:2002:CST:779110.779112}. They generate C-code for a Lego
Mindstorms system using TIMES, checking for reachability and
schedulability. Similar to what we are trying to do with ECDAR.

%There are certain differences between TIMES and ECDAR, despite the missing
%feature of code generation in ECDAR. In contrast to TIMES's programmable logic
%controllers, a scheduling approach is not sufficient to deal with unpredictable
%behaviour in ECDAR.  Looking at what are taking as input by the controller -
%TIMES simple takes a model, checking reachability and schedulability, %whereas
%ECDAR synthesise each component in a model.

\paragraph{Composable Code Generation for Model-Based Development}
by Kirk Schloegel et al. present a framework for generating
code\cite{composable-code-generation}. They emphasize how utilizing their
framework, code generators aren't programs separated from a corresponding
graphical model as it often have been in the past. Our code generator isn't
based on this framework. However, their approach towards developing code generators
with focus on graphical models is analogous to our approach with ECDAR.

\paragraph{Code Synthesis for Timed Automata}
by Tobias Amnell et al. present a framework for the development of real-time
embedded systems\cite{Amnell:2002:CST:779110.779112}. Their work is similar to
our project. In the article they illustrate how their framework is based on timed
automata and real-time tasks -- similar to our concept with ECDAR.

\paragraph{Controller Program Synthesis for Industrial Machines}
a PhD thesis report by Hans-JÃ¶rg Peter describes a new synthesis algorithm for
industrial controller programs. His solutions is based on timed automata to
synthesize code from model that generates assembler code for Siemens
programmable logic controller used commonly used for industrial
machines \cite{controller-program-synthesis:2005}.
