The aim of this project is to develop a tool for automatic synthesis of Java-code, from the modeling tool: ECDAR. However there already exist tools similar too ECDAR.

TIMES\footnote{\url{http://www.timestool.com}}: is a graphical tool set for modeling, schedulability analysis for implementation of embedded systems. It allows users to model a system and the abstract behavior of its environment. 
Like ECDAR, TIMES is based on timed automata (See section \ref{introduction-ecdar} on page \pageref{introduction-ecdar} for more details on automaton). Similarly TIMES derive from UPPAAL and is based on the standard for modeling real-time systems \cite{Alur1994:183}.
Times is extended by real-time tasks, checking the reachability and schedulability of a modelled automata. It too can simulate models and validate dynamic behavior of a system: Users can see how tasks executes according to time. The simulator shows a graphical representation of the generated trace, showing the time points when the tasks are released, invoked, suspended, resumed, and completed.

TIMES can be used for code-generate, as illustrated Tobias Amnell et al \cite{Amnell:2002:CST:779110.779112}. They generate C-code for a Lego Mindstorms system using TIMES, checking for reachability and schedulability. Similar to what we trying to do with ECDAR. 

%----
There are certain differences between TIMES and ECDAR, despite the missing feature of code generation in ECDAR. In contrast to TIMES's programmable logic controllers, a scheduling approach is not sufficient to deal with unpredictable behavior in ECDAR.
Looking at what are taking as input by the controller - TIMES simple takes a model, checking reachability and schedulability, whereas ECDAR synthesize each component in a model.



\paragraph{Composable Code Generation for Model-Based Development}
by Kirk Schloegel et al. present a framework for generating
code\cite{composable-code-generation}. They emphasize how utilizing their
framework, code generators aren't programs separated from a corresponding
graphical model as it often have been in the past. Our code generator isn't
based on this framework, however their approach on developing code generators
with focus on graphical models is related to our approach with ECDAR.

\paragraph{Code Synthesis for Timed Automata}
by Tobias Amnell et al. present a framework for the development of real-time
embedded systems\cite{Amnell:2002:CST:779110.779112}. Their work is similar to
our project. In the article the illustrate how their framework is based on timed
automata and real-time tasks - relative to our concept with ECDAR.
