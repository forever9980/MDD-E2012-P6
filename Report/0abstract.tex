This paper present a framework for code generation, based on timed automata
modeled in ECDAR (Environment for Compositional Design and Analysis of Real Time
Systems). ECDAR is a graphical tool based on UPPAAL that allows to visually
create models of real-time systems.

The motivation for doing this project is that the current version of the ECDAR
framework is lacking an important feature: the possibility to utilize models for
code generation, as a way to develop software solutions based on visually
represented models.

The general approach of this project is to solve this aforementioned challenge:
Show how one can generate true code, in this case Java, from an ECDAR model
(\ref{implementation}). This is done in two closely related parts. The first
part is a framework build to match the single parts of the ECDAR specification
(\ref{implementation-framework}). The second part presents how to generate
compilable code from an ECDAR model. The code basis of the generated code is
aforementioned framework(\ref{implementation-code-generation}).

The functionality of the framework is evaluated through a series of tests
(\ref{Testing}). We show that the our developed framework for code generation from
ECDAR is a valid approach.
