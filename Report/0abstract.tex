This paper present a framework for code generation, based on timed automata
modelled in ECDAR (Environment for Compositional Design and Analysis of Real
Time Systems). A graphical tool based on UPPAAL that allows to visually create
models of real-time systems.

A key feature missing in ECDAR is the possibility to utilize models for code
generation, as a way to develop software solutions based on visually represented
models.

The purpose of this project is to solve this challenge: Show how one can generate true code, in this case Java, from an ECDAR model. 
This is done in two related parts. The first part is a framework build on the ECDAR specification. The second part defines how to generate code from an ECDAR model. In order to solve these challenges, it was necessary to introduce the notation of tasks as an extension to the ECDAR model, within the framework.

The functionality of the framework is evaluated through a series of test. All of
which is based on beverage-serving machine model (See figure \ref{bev-machine}
on page \pageref{bev-machine}).
