The proposed implementation of the ECDAR code generator is split up
in two parts. The first part is a framework of abstract classes, implementing
in as much detail as possible the single parts of ECDAR specifications
(i.e. edges, locations, TIOA). The second is the actual code generation.
Our code generator generates sources which inherit from the abstract
framework to minimize the amount of code that needs actually to be
generated. This means that nearly all design decisions have been made
prior to generating code, reducing space for possible errors. This
section describes our implemented subset of ECDAR and the code generator
in detail.

\subsection{Tasks}

ECDAR defines the behavior of a system as a state machine. This behavior
is, however, still too abstract to justify code generation. We can
generate code which implements the behavior of state machines, but
in essence, the system would then only produce messages.

To make this tool more useful, we introduce the notion of tasks as
an extension to the language. Let $T_{S}$ be a set of tasks and $L_{S}$
a set of locations on a system $S$. Then $\forall l\in L_{s}\exists t\in T_{s}$,
i.e. each location is assigned exactly one task. A task is a procedure
which will be executed as soon as an automaton traverses over an edge,
arriving at a new location.

Tasks can either be preemptive or non-preemptive. This property becomes
important for defining behavior of automata when they are notified
about input by the controller.

ECDAR is input-enabled (see Sect. \ref{background-ecdar}) and therefore,
the system is required to react to input immediately. As a consequence,
there must also be a well defined reaction to input during the execution
of a task.

When an automaton is executing a task and it receives an input message
which it accepts, it may stop the currently executed task and proceed
as originally defined in ECDAR (i.e. traverse the corresponding edge),
if and only if the task is preemptive. Otherwise, the given input
will be ignored and the execution of the task continues.

To determine if a task is preemptive is up to the designer of the
system to decide. By default are all tasks non-preemptive.

\subsection{The ECDAR Framework}
\label{implementation-framework}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/ecdar_architecture} 
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Schematic of the architecture of our ECDAR implementation.}
\end{figure}

The architecture we chose is based upon the work of Amnell et al.\cite{amnell_code_2002}
with some modifications. Communication between automata is implemented
as message passing between environment and automata, where automata
send messages to the environment by traversing over output edges --
there are no shared variables (see Sect. \ref{background-tioa}). Messages
are processed by a controller object, which initializes automata and
also notifies automata about received messages.

We require multiple automata to execute in quasi-parallel. Therefore,
we do not queue tasks. Since the automata are moved to classical threading
architecture, we do not require multiple processor units. Instead,
the controller and each automaton run in separate threads. Since there
is no communication between automata directly, we can minimize synchronizing
so that nearly no waiting is required.

The following overview will give further implementation details on each
component of ECDAR as we implemented it. Each component is illustrated with a
short code example, implementing ECDAR's "University"
example \footnote{\url{http://people.cs.aau.dk/adavid/ecdar/examples.html\#university}}. For
clarity, we omit the framework implementation and focus on the generated code.

\subsubsection{Locations.}

Each location is a associated with a task. Task execution is implemented
in a separate thread, not blocking the execution of the automaton.
Locations are implemented as objects holding an array of edges that
point away from it. (See Fig. \ref{location-example})

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting[linerange={101-132}]{code/Machine.java}
\caption{Example of location code.}
\label{location-example}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Edges.}

An edge holds a reference to the location which the parent automaton
will be at after traversing this very edge. Edges can be asked if
they will be available at a given time. This is implemented to enable
lazy waiting in the automaton's traversal checker. Each edge is associated
with some input. If an edge is controllable, it will be triggered
if the automaton is notified at this input. If it is uncontrollable,
it will send its input to the controller. Furthermore, edges have
access to the clock of the parent automaton to reset it appropriately.

The implementation makes a class-wise distinction between controllable
and uncontrollable edges and hard-codes the behavior for given input.
Such hard-coded features are e.g. notifying the controller on traversing
an uncontrollable edge. (See Fig. \ref{edge-example})


\subsection{TIOA.}

The implementation of timed I/O automata holds a set of locations
and a reference to the location it is currently at. The TIOA is executed
by a thread that keeps checking for available edges and traverses
along these, as soon as they become enabled. To check if an edge is
available, let $E_{s\rightarrow t}$ be an edge where $s,\, t$ are
start and target locations respectively. Furthermore, let $g(E)$
be a function evaluating the guard of an edge $E$ and $I(l)$ a function
evaluating the invariant of a location $l$. Our implementation uses
$g'(E_{s\rightarrow t})=g(E_{s\rightarrow t})\wedge I(t)$ to check
if $E_{s\rightarrow t}$ is available.

Additionally, the automaton has the ability to return the current
local clock state (see \ref{implementation-presumptions}) and to
reset the clock. We use the same notion of clocks as \cite{amnell_code_2002},
where time on the local clock is the difference between the current
time on the system clock and the time the local clock was started.
Resetting the local clock means to use the current system clock time
as the new start time. (See Fig. \ref{tioa-example})

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting[linerange={8-8,169-184}]{code/Machine.java}
\caption{Example of TIOA code.}
\label{tioa-example}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Controller.}

The controller holds all automata given in the specification, executes
them initially in quasi-parallel and notifies automata about input
from the environment. It is a singleton, accessible in a static fashion.
This property is useful for uncontrollable edges that need to notify
the controller about input. (See Fig. \ref{controller-example})

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting[linerange={6-11,63-64}]{code/UniversityController.java}
\caption{Example of controller code.}
\label{controller-example}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Synchronization}

In the framework implementation, the Java keyword \textit{synchronized} is 
used for making certain operations quasi-atomic. That means, that a set of
instructions may not be interrupted by the execution of another thread -- 
i.e. traversals over edges.

This is mainly used for the logging of signals, so that logging time
is preserved and the output appears in the right order. \textit{Synchronized}
is also used, to set some internal states on TIOA, where the internal state
consists of multiple values that need to be set at the same time.

\textit{Synchronized} is furthermore used to prioritize handling of input.  The
method on the controller object, that is handling the signal, as well as those
on the TIOA that react to a signal if it is accepted, are modified with
\textit{synchronized}. This ensures that, before everything else, the input is
processed.


\subsection{Code Generation}
\label{implementation-code-generation}

In the implementation presented the actual generation of source code is done
through a model to text transformation. The generation outputs compilable
JAVA-code based on input from an ECDAR file.

The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) is utilized for the process. EMF is a
modeling framework and code generation facility for building applications based
on a structured data model. From a model specification described in XMI, EMF
provides tools and runtime support to produce a set of Java classes for the
model, along with a set of adapter classes that enable viewing and command-based
editing of the model and it provides a basic editor.  The core EMF framework
includes a meta model (Ecore) for describing models and runtime support for the
models including: change notification, persistence support with default XMI
serialization, and a very efficient reflective API for manipulating EMF objects
generically. In the implementation presented in this paper an Xtext environment
is generated from the ECDAR Ecore model. Xtext is a framework for development of
programming languages and domain specific languages.

In order to generate code from the model it's imperative to follow a process of
multiple steps: Get the input from ECDAR, translate this to Xtext ECDAR DSL,
setup a workflow that manages the process and finally a XPAND-template is needed
to define how the transformation output should look like. Each step is being
described in more detail in the following section.

\subsubsection{Transformation process}
\label{transformation-process}

The initial output from the ECDAR tool is in the XML-format. This XML-output
contains a complete definition of the model with locations, edges, variables,
transformations etc. In order to work with these files and do the actual code
generation, a conversion to Xtext ECDAR DSL is needed. For this conversion we
are using a converter (courtesy of Bastian) that simply takes the ECDAR XML-file
and converts it to ECDAR DSL. The ECDAR DSL syntax is defined in our Xtext ECDAR
environment. With the combination of the Ecore meta model and the Xtext syntax a
workflow can be defined. This workflow is describing how to handle the
generation process. This is done with the help of the Modeling Workflow Engine 2
(MWE2). Also referenced in the workflow is the template that describes how the
actual output is going to look like. The templates are written using
Xpand. Xpand is a statically typed template language. Conveniently Xpand
supports code-completion directly connected to the Ecore model defined in the
MWE2 workflow, but also comes with syntax coloring, refactoring and error
highlighting. The output generation results for the system presented in this
paper are based on serveral workflows and templates to do the rather complex
transformations: One set of workflows and templates for respectively the
Specification, Controller and Environment.

More specifically in the workflow-file one defines what model to use, a
slot-name to refer to later and an entry point. The entry point defines which
class element is the top or root element. The entry-element that is defined for
the three afformentioned workflows is "ETSpecificationDefinition". Also defined
in the workflow is how to use the entry-element. For instance in the
specification workflow it is defined that for each "ETSpecificationDefinition" a
transformation is done using the Xpand template for this particular
generation. The end result is having generated ouput for each specification that
was initialy described and modeled from within the ECDAR XML-file.

With the workflow fully configured, the next step is to write the
transformation. This is done in a Xpand template. The snippets in figure
\ref{xpand-example} shows some important steps.

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting[linerange={1-2}]{code/TemplateSpecifications.xpt}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={6-6}]{code/TemplateSpecifications.xpt}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={34-41}]{code/TemplateSpecifications.xpt}
\caption{Snippets from Xpand-template \label{xpand-example}}
\end{figure}

The arrows, known as guillemets (``\guillemotleft'' and `` \guillemotright''),
shows where in figure \ref{xpand-example} the XPAND language is in place. First
of all an import of the model is done in the first line, referenced as
ecdarText. We then proceed to one of the central concepts of Xpand by using the
define-block; This is where we define our template. We only use one template is
this specific file, but it could have contained multiple, which would have
resulted in multiple define-blocks. In the next and last snippet we jump to a
part where we are iterating through each edge and create a constructor for the
current class. In the first line we create the constructor by inserting the text
"Edge" and add the number the iterator has reached. We then iterate through a
list of the current Edges variables, which should be one signal, and returns the
results as a list. We furthermore use a new iterator to keep track of this
itereation. We afterwards check if it's the first iteration, and if it is, we
print out the edges target name and the variable signal, such as "super(C,
"signal");".

The notion of tasks as previous described in section 3.2. is accounted for in
our generated output. In the controller we generate functions that will be
invoked at each location. A task is a procedure which will be executed as soon
as an automaton traverses over an edge, arriving at a new location. There can
only be one task pr. location. The thought behind having all methods in the
controller is for a better overview and a centralized customizeable file.
