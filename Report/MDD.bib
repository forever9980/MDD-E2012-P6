	abstract = {We present a framework for the development of real-time embedded systems based on timed automata extended with a notion of real-time tasks. It has been shown previously that teachability and schedulability for such automata can be checked effectively using model checking techniques. In this paper, we propose to use the extended automata as design models. We describe how to compile design models to executable programs with predictable behaviours. The compiling procedure ensures that the execution of the generated code satisfies mixed timing, resource and logical constraints imposed on the design model. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a prototype C-code generator based on the {legOS} operating system has been implemented in the {TIMES} tool and applied to develop the control software for a production cell. The production cell has been built in {LEGO®} equipped with a Hitachi H8 based {LEGO®} Mindstorms control brick.},
