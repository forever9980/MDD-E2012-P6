ECDAR is a TIOA modeler based on UPPAAL. A similar tool based on UPPAAL already exists. I.e. Times \cite{timestool} a tool for modeling and implementation of embedded systems. Times is a graphical simulator, in which a user can validate dynamic behavior of a system and see how tasks execute - much like Ecdar, but it can also do code-generation. However there is a difference between Ecdar and Times. Looking at what are taking as input by the controller - Times simple takes a model and generates code. ECDAR: Synthesize models for you so to avoid “that” stage. In ECDAR you have the possibility to you use composition.
