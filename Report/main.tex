\begin{abstract}
The following paper is examining the possibilities of utilising code generation in regards to Timed Input Output Automata (TIOA). The basis is ECDAR, a TIOA modeller based on UPPAAL, which we have developed a generator for real-time java. Since there already exist a TIOA model code generator, Times Tool, this paper will review the differences in implementation and their implications.

\section{Introduction\label{introduction}}

In the preceeding years a new level of abstraction in development is evolving. Utilizing a higher level of abstraction, than high-level programming languages, we have Model Driven Development. This new paradigm is bla bla bla

Real time systems are all around us, we find them in planes, cars, buildings, supermarkets, and even in ourself (Pacemakers). BLABLA LBALBLA ever importance of testing and securing stability and not the least MODELING - blablabla

SHOULD BE REWRITTEN TO MATCH THE FINAL PRODUCT
\newline
As complexity of Software Projects grows, it becomes necessary to lift abstraction to a higher level. This is very useful when experts from specific domains who are not familiar with classical programming need to develop systems. Instead of educating programmers in these domains, we can increase productivity by giving aforementioned experts the proper tools to develop these systems which also enables re-usability.
\newline
These tools usually create models which specify the desired program. Since a model is just an abstract representation, the need for tools that generate actual executable program code is obvious. This project focuses on ECDAR, a modelling language for the specification of Timed I/O Automata.

\section{Method (Copy/Paste from project proposal)}
%
SHOULD BE REWRITTEN TO MATCH THE FINAL PRODUCT
\newline
Our main goal is to be able to translate simple ECDAR models into compilable and executable code. The target language is yet to be determined. We will base our implementation on a parser generated from an already existing ECDAR meta-model. This will possibly be altered to fit our needs. Furthermore we will use relevant literature as our theoretical basis for code generation. 
\newline
An extended goal of this project is to implement code generation for composed TIOA. Here, we will focus on the parallel-composition operator which combines two TIOA to run in parallel on the same system. 
\newline
The result of this project will be a code generation tool for simple TIOA, possibly extended to generating code for parallel automata. This, together with the report, can build a foundation for further projects aiming to generate code from ECDAR models. It is also an important step towards additional value for the industry to encourage using high-level TIOA modelling.
