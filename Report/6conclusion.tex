In this project we showed how to develop a code generator for TIOA 
models created by ECDAR. 

First by building a framework of abstract classes in Java, based on 
ECDAR. This entails locations, edges and TIOA with a modified messaging 
system based on tasks and a controller class. The Java keyword 
\textit{synchronized} is used for for logging time, internal states and 
maintaining priority. 

Secondly by defining the code generation, with a model to text 
transformation, that inherits from the abstract classes in the 
framework. More concretely used the translated input from ECDAR, and 
utilized an Xpand-template to generate the code. 

In our implementation we assumed ECDAR specifications to be valid 
testing was accomplished through compiling, log file testing and manual 
comparison.
