In this project we showed a valid approach towards developing a code 
generator for TIOA models created by ECDAR. 

First by building a framework of abstract classes in Java, based on 
ECDAR. This entails locations, edges and TIOA with a modified messaging 
system based on tasks and a controller class. The Java keyword 
\textit{synchronized} is used for logging time, internal states and 
maintaining priority. 

Secondly by defining the code generation, with a model to text 
transformation, that inherits from the abstract classes in the 
framework. More concretely used the translated input from ECDAR, and 
utilized an Xpand-template to generate the code. 

In our implementation we assumed ECDAR specifications to be valid. 
Testing was accomplished through compiling, automatic and manual log 
file testing. 

Further work is possible by converting our framework for use with the 
Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ). RTSJ is a set of interfaces and 
behavioral specifications that allow for real-time programming in the 
Java programming language 
\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index- 
jsp-139921.html}}. RTSJ implements a subset of the Java library and guarantees
timing and thread prioritization.

Also, further validation of the system by extending automated tests to check
timing and by using multiple specifications should be conducted in the future.
