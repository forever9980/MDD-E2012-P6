\subsection{Testing}
\label{Testing}
In order to test our software solution three different testing methods have been
arranged.

\subsubsection{Compiling properly}
Making sure every output compiles properly.

\subsubsection{Logfile testing}
For the project an logfile analysis program have been incorporated. A small
program verifying that the signals in the generator code are fired in the right
order according to the input model.  The analysis program is hardcoded to match
our testing model (see Fig. \ref{simple-model}). Thus it is checking for signals
like: GRANT, COIN and TEA, in the specifyied order. If a signal is called within
the generator before it is supposed too (e.g TEA before COIN) the analysis
program will call for an ERROR.

The logfile contain timestamps of global time from each atomaton in a model. The
global time can then be verified by comparison with time assigned within the
ECDAR modelling tool.

\subsubsection{Manual Comparison}
Final testing procedure is a manual step-by-step comparison of a simple
graphical atomaton model and the corisponding code generated. Cycling through
the times, comparing each step with the output.

\subsection{Presumptions and Resulting Motivations}
\label{implementation-presumptions}

Our implementation represents only a subset of actual ECDAR. Currently, the
implementation assumes only one clock per automaton. Also, we assume the
specification to be valid, since there are other tools that verify
correctness\footnote{\url{http://people.cs.aau.dk/adavid/ecdar/}}.

The only operator we implement for code generation is the parallel
composition operator. Let $M$ be the type ECDAR specification. Then
all operators in ECDAR are of type $M_{i}\otimes M_{j}\rightarrow M_{ij}$.
Other than for the majority of operators, which refine the specification,
it is impractical to implement parallel composition as a model-to-model
transformation, since it produces the cross-product of two models
\cite{david_compositional_2012}. These models are size $|M_{i}|\cdot|M_{j}|$
and generating code for them would consume a large amount of memory
and raise complexity. This would be inappropriate for an embedded
system. We elaborate on this further in Sect. \ref{implementation-framework}.

ECDAR specifications are written on the assumption of the synchrony
hypothesis (see Sect. \ref{background-ecdar}) \cite{david_compositional_2012}.
This is an important property for code generation, as reasoning about
time differences in execution becomes unnecessary for the developer.
However, we still kept overhead low to achieve reasonable fast performance.

%To produce feasible code that would be able to run on embedded systems,
%we targeted Real-Time Java (Java RTS)%
%\footnote{\href{}{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-139921.html}%
%}. Java RTS was designed to improve upon standard Java in terms of
%timing accuracy an real-time embedded systems.
